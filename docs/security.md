# Security Best Practices

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

PhantomStrikes is designed for educational security research. This guide outlines best practices for secure and responsible usage.

## üîí Privacy Protection

### Tor Integration

Always use Tor for anonymous testing:

```bash
# Enable Tor anonymization
python src/phantomstrikes.py -t target.com -r 256 -T

# Verify Tor connection
curl --socks5 localhost:9050 --socks5-hostname localhost:9050 -s https://check.torproject.org/
```

### VPN Usage

Use a VPN in addition to Tor for extra privacy:

```bash
# Check your IP before and after VPN
curl ifconfig.me
```

### Data Protection

- **Clear Logs Regularly**: Remove sensitive data after testing
- **Encrypt Storage**: Use encrypted volumes for sensitive data
- **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS and encrypted channels

## üö® Legal Compliance

### Authorization Requirements

**NEVER test systems without proper authorization:**

1. **Own Systems**: Only test systems you own
2. **Written Permission**: Get explicit written consent
3. **Scope Definition**: Clearly define testing scope
4. **Legal Review**: Consult legal experts if unsure

### Jurisdiction Awareness

- **Local Laws**: Understand your local cybersecurity laws
- **International Laws**: Be aware of cross-border implications
- **Industry Regulations**: Follow industry-specific regulations

### Documentation

Keep detailed records of:

```bash
# Authorization documents
# Testing scope and timeline
# Results and findings
# Remediation recommendations
```

## üîß Secure Configuration

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Use isolated environments
python -m venv phantomstrikes_env
source phantomstrikes_env/bin/activate

# Secure configuration
export PHANTOMSTRIKES_SECURE_MODE=true
export PHANTOMSTRIKES_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
```

### Network Isolation

```bash
# Use isolated networks
docker network create phantomstrikes-isolated

# Run in isolated container
docker run --network phantomstrikes-isolated phantomstrikes
```

### Access Control

```bash
# Restrict file permissions
chmod 600 config/sensitive.conf
chmod 700 logs/

# Use non-root user
sudo -u phantomstrikes python src/phantomstrikes.py
```

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

### Security Logging

```bash
# Enable security logging
export PHANTOMSTRIKES_SECURITY_LOG=true

# Monitor access logs
tail -f logs/security.log

# Check for suspicious activity
grep "WARNING\|ERROR" logs/phantomstrikes.log
```

### Real-time Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor system resources
htop

# Check network connections
netstat -tuln

# Monitor file changes
inotifywait -m -r /path/to/phantomstrikes/
```

## üö® Incident Response

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Immediate Stop**
   ```bash
   # Stop all processes
   pkill -f phantomstrikes
   
   # Disconnect network
   sudo ifconfig eth0 down
   ```

2. **Evidence Preservation**
   ```bash
   # Create forensic copy
   dd if=/dev/sda of=evidence.img bs=4M
   
   # Preserve logs
   tar -czf logs_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz logs/
   ```

3. **Notification**
   - Contact system administrators
   - Report to relevant authorities if required
   - Document incident details

### Recovery Procedures

```bash
# Restore from backup
tar -xzf backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz

# Verify system integrity
sha256sum -c checksums.txt

# Test functionality
python src/phantomstrikes.py --help
```

## üîç Vulnerability Assessment

### Regular Security Audits

```bash
# Run security scans
bandit -r src/
safety check
pip-audit

# Check for CVEs
nvd-cli search phantomstrikes
```

### Code Review

```bash
# Static analysis
pylint src/
flake8 src/
mypy src/

# Dependency analysis
pipdeptree
```

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Testing

- [ ] Obtain proper authorization
- [ ] Define testing scope
- [ ] Set up isolated environment
- [ ] Enable logging and monitoring
- [ ] Configure privacy protection
- [ ] Review legal requirements

### During Testing

- [ ] Monitor system resources
- [ ] Check for unexpected behavior
- [ ] Log all activities
- [ ] Maintain privacy protection
- [ ] Follow defined scope

### After Testing

- [ ] Stop all processes
- [ ] Clear sensitive data
- [ ] Generate reports
- [ ] Document findings
- [ ] Recommend remediation
- [ ] Archive evidence

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools Integration

### Additional Security Tools

```bash
# Install security tools
pip install bandit safety pip-audit

# Run security checks
bandit -r src/ -f json -o security_report.json
safety check --json
pip-audit --format json
```

### Continuous Security

```bash
# Automated security scanning
make security

# Integration with CI/CD
# Add to .github/workflows/security.yml
```
